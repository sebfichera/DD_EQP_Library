DD EQP Library - A library for integration of polynomials times double step function
in quadrilateral domains v 1.0 July 2022

Currently, Double Discontinuity (DD) EQP Library includes functions for the evaluation of Equivalent Polynomials
for 2D quadrilateral finite elements containing double discontinuities.

The DD EQP Library archive download contains: the Fortran90 source code of the Library;
two Fortran90 usage example files.

The \src folder contains both the source code for the library and a script ("main.f90") to run
the library itself. Two .txt demonstrative examples are also provided.

To compile the library and the demonstrative example, all the .f90 files inside the \src
folder have to be compiled.
It is necessary to use the "-ffree-line-length-none" directive.

One can just paste this path into the terminal to build the code and obtain an executable file:

For Windows:
gfortran -ffree-line-length-none absolute_path\src\*.f90 -o DD_EQP

For Linux/Mac:
gfortran -ffree-line-length-none absolute_path/src/*.f90 -o DD_EQP

** "absolute_path" in the command line above has to be replaced with the correct complete library path.
